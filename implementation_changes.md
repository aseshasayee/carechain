# Implementation Changes

## WebSocket Path Mismatch - FIXED
The WebSocket URL path in the frontend was not matching the backend configuration. This resulted in connection failures to the chat server.

**Changes:**
- Updated `api-config.js` WebSocket URL from `ws://localhost:8000/ws/chat/` to `ws://localhost:8000/api/ws/chat/`

## Redis Connection Reliability - FIXED
Redis connection issues were causing WebSocket failures with no fallback mechanism.

**Changes:**
- Added `check_channel_layer` function to verify Redis connection health
- Implemented proper error handling in `connect` method
- Created a polling fallback mechanism with exponential backoff for when WebSockets fail
- Added proper logging throughout the WebSocket consumer code

## Mobile-Responsive Design - FIXED
The application was not optimized for mobile devices, making it difficult to use on smaller screens.

**Changes:**
- Created new `mobile.css` stylesheet with comprehensive mobile-specific styles
- Added responsive breakpoints and mobile-friendly layouts
- Optimized navigation, forms, tables, and cards for mobile viewing
- Implemented responsive grid layouts and flexible containers

## Advanced Job Search - FIXED
The job search functionality was basic and didn't provide relevant matches based on candidate skills and preferences.

**Changes:**
- Implemented `AdvancedJobSearchView` using PostgreSQL full-text search
- Added skill matching using fuzzy string comparison
- Created location proximity matching
- Added experience level and salary range matching
- Implemented weighted scoring system for more relevant results
- Updated API documentation to include the new endpoint

## Login Authentication Flow - FIXED
Users were having issues logging in with the correct roles and credentials. The frontend was not properly handling role verification.

**Changes:**
- Fixed user role storage in localStorage during login by adding proper role flags (isAdmin, isRecruiter, isCandidate)
- Improved error handling and error messages during login
- Removed demo/mock data that was overriding actual user authentication
- Added proper role verification on dashboard pages
- Added console logging for authentication debugging
- Enhanced UI feedback with success/error messages and redirect delays
- Fixed handling of missing user data or tokens
- Implemented fallback protection for missing user profile fields

## API Endpoint Configuration - FIXED
The frontend was trying to use endpoints that don't exist in the backend, causing 404 errors.

**Changes:**
- Updated `api-config.js` to match actual backend endpoints
- Fixed JOBS.POSTED_JOBS to use '/jobs/' instead of non-existent '/jobs/posted-jobs/'
- Fixed JOBS.DETAIL to use '/jobs/' endpoint with id parameter
- Fixed JOBS.APPLY and MY_APPLICATIONS to use correct paths
- Updated frontend code in recruiter_dashboard.html to use correct endpoints
- Added more detailed console logging to help troubleshoot URL issues

## Profile Handling - FIXED
The recruiter dashboard was failing because some users didn't have recruiter profiles.

**Changes:**
- Modified `RecruiterProfileDetailView` to automatically create profiles when they don't exist
- Added profile creation fallback in the frontend when 404 errors are encountered
- Added debugging functionality to help initialize test data when needed
- Improved error handling to provide more useful information when profiles are missing
- Enhanced profile status checking and automatic creation of missing profiles
- Added graceful fallbacks for verification status handling

## Verification Status Endpoint - FIXED
The candidate verification status wasn't properly showing "Verified" after admin approval.

**Changes:**
- Added the missing `verification-status/` endpoint to the profile URLs configuration
- Updated `VerificationStatusView` to include the candidate's actual verification status in the response
- Modified the frontend code to use the verification status field from the API
- Added better error handling and logging for verification status checks
- Updated the UI to properly reflect the actual verification status from the backend instead of using only local calculations

## Database Migration Status

No schema changes were needed for the above fixes. All changes were at the application code level.
